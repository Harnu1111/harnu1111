### Hi there 👋



<h2>I'm Anuoluwapo</h2>

<p>A frontend developer and a technical writer who has dedicated a part of my life to beautifying the web. Doing so with passion and frequent desire to learn and build</p>

<p> Along with designing nice web templates on figma, i have been dedicated to be fluent in JavaScripted which prompted most of my designs to be in React. React is a cool framework and im also fluent designing with pure CSS. I am also a technical writer writing Scripts on global scale </p>
